## WHAT I LEARNED:
1.) The use of Media queries in css to make a responsive web page. 

2.) When and how to use hover and Touch events. (Although a touch event doesnt reproduce a hoover effect which could introduce a chance to refactor for better mobile design.)

3.) Learned how to harness the power of CSS Grids.
